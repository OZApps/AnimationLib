It can be used with spritesheets that are laid out horizontally.\r\n\r\nFrame1 | Frame2 | Frame3 | Frame4 | Frame5 | ...\r\n\r\nYou can initialise the animation with\r\n\r\n<b>```local myAnim = animation.new(\"anim1.png\", 6, 4, 1)```</b><br>\r\nwhere the syntax is <code>animation.new(imageFileName, maxFrames, tickSpeed, scale)</code><br>\r\n  _imageFileName_ is the image that holds all the images horizontally <-- <i>This is important</i><br>\r\n  _maxFrames_ tells the animation the number of frames that the image has. <br>\r\n      The dimensions of this image should be FrameWidth x maxFrames<br>\r\n  _tickSpeed_ is what determines the speed at which the animation is updated. <br>\r\n      While some animations work on time, this one is set up on frames to skip before updating<br>\r\n  scale is used if you want to scale your animation to a smaller size (fit retina animation on a normal device)<br>\r\n\r\nThe other functions available with this library are<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:setFrame(frameNumber)```</b><br>\r\n    the frameNumber is between 1 and maxFrames<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:play()```</b><br>\r\n    starts playing the animation. Generaly automatically started when a new instance is created<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:pause()```</b><br>\r\n    toggles the playing of the animation<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:stop(atFrame)```</b><br>\r\n    stops the animation and sets the frame to the atFrame or the first frame<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:setPosition(xPos, yPos)```</b><br>\r\n    positions the animation sprite to the position xPos, yPos on the screen<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:setX(xPos)```</b><br>\r\n    sets the position of the x co-ordinate of the sprite<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:setY(yPos)```</b><br>\r\n    sets the position of the y co-ordinate of the sprite<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:setAlpha(theAlpha)```</b><br>\r\n    sets the alpha of the sprite<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:setScale(xScale, yScale)```</b><br>\r\n    sets the scale of the sprite, if only one value is passed, it is applied to both x and y<br>\r\n  <b>```animation:setGroup(theGroup)```</b><br>\r\n    This is used to make the sprite part of another sprite object than the stage.<br>\r\n\r\nLicense: If you use this code, you need to attribute it to the Author Jayant C Varma from OZApps (http://www.oz-apps.com) in your credits.\r\nIf you feel that you would rather pay than to credit, you can make a payment of $25 via PayPal instead."}
